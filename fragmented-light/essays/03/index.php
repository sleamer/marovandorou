					<p>WASHI: THE JAPANESE HANDMADE PAPER<br /><em>Essay by Maro Vandorou</em></p>
					<div class="colwrap">
						<div class="col w400">
							<p>I have a true passion for rare, handmade papers which I consider an integral part of the aesthetic and emotional interpretation of my images.  My favorite paper is made from the fibers of the Gampi bush.  This plant produces paper that is translucent, with superlative beauty and a smooth surface that glows. It is fragile, yet incredibly strong. I feel as if this paper has its own &ldquo;live energy&rdquo;.  When I am working with Gampi, it demands my total, uninterrupted concentration throughout all stages of the Platinotype process, in order to bring to life the vision that my images attempt to capture. Unlike Kozo and Mitsumata, the plants used for most Japanese paper, Gampi can not be cultivated.  It grows in the wild, in the mild, mountainous regions of Japan.  Harvesting of the Gampi stalks takes place between February and March, when the stalks are fully hydrated; it is then easy to remove the bark from the stalks without traumatizing it.  The innermost white layer of the bark is used for making Gampi, after the external black layer and the middle green layer have been stripped away. The clean white strands of Gampi are bundled together and placed to dry in a cool, shady place.</p>
							<p>For the next stage of paper making, these strands are placed in a large tub where they are cooked for three to four hours until very soft.</p>

							<p>Chirotiri (removing of the dark spots) follows. It is a labor intensive and time consuming process. A small amount of the cooked fiber is put into a bamboo basket floating in water and then any scar tissue, dark spot or unevenly cooked parts are removed by hand.  The Gampi fibers are then beaten on a stone using a wooden mallet. This is done so that the fibers are separated and hydrated for the sheets to be smooth and homogeneous.  Sheet formation involves mixing Gampi pulp and Neri, a type of natural glue.  Using a bamboo screen and a wood frame the mixture is moved back and forth, and side to side across the mold to form the sheet. The fiber settles on the screen and the step is repeated again and again until the desired thickness is achieved. The screen with the completed sheet of paper is then removed from the mould and placed on top of other previously made sheets, being left overnight to drain naturally.  Later, it will be carefully pressed until approximately thirty percent of the moisture is removed.  The paper is removed from the stack and placed on drying boards and taken out into the sun. The sun and wind dry and bleach the paper.  In the final stage of inspection, dried sheets of Gampi are held up to the light and classified by thickness, color etc. It is now ready for use.</p>
