						<p><em>Fragmented Light</em> is the first part of a trilogy that documents a personal journey of profound transformation. The series references time &mdash; elapsed, logical, linear time &mdash; and time of the heart and emotions. In a visit to my birthplace I reflect on my roots, my decisions and their consequences, as I struggle to reconcile the essence of existence and of human emotions beyond place and beyond time. Infused by the emotional energy of Keramicos, an ancient cemetery in Athens, Greece, the images printed as Platinotypes on precious Gampi paper are in themselves fragile memory fragments. My prints combine the austere monochromatic beauty and permanence of a historic photographic process with the fragility and timelessness of a rare Japanese paper.</p>
